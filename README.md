# crawler-4-cache
Crawls a single website to open all the webpages for preloading a server/browser cache
For a small site, this seems like a better solution than running a wget for all the files only to delete them.

pip install what you need to run it.
change the website url at the bottom of the file

you can edit the list of exclusions such as jpg png webp etc
